Enable credit card payments through Barion on Fluent Forms (https://fluentforms.com/?ref=2142) payment forms.

== Description ==

This plugin allows your customers to pay via [Barion Smart Gateway](https://www.barion.com/) with Fluent  Forms.

Fluent Forms (https://fluentforms.com/?ref=2142) is a powerful WordPress form builder plugin designed to create custom forms easily with a drag-and-drop interface. It offers advanced functionalities like conditional logic, multi-step forms, and integrations with popular payment gateways, CRMs, and email marketing tools.

== Third-party Services ==

This plugin integrates with the **Barion Payment Gateway**, a third-party service provided by Barion Payment Inc. It relies on the Barion API to process credit card transactions and the **Barion Pixel** for tracking user interactions to help prevent fraud.

=== Data Transmitted to Barion: ===

- **Payment Information**: Users' payment details (e.g., credit card data) are securely sent to Barion during transaction processing.
- **Tracking Information**: The Barion Pixel is implemented to track user behavior on your website, such as page views, which are transmitted to Barion to help detect fraudulent activity.

=== Barion Pixel Usage: ===

The **Base Barion Pixel** collects rudimentary data (like page views) to support fraud prevention. This pixel is necessary for using the Barion Payment Gateway. No personally identifiable information is used for marketing purposes unless explicit user consent is provided. The data is transmitted securely to Barion's servers via TLS encryption.

**Service URL**: https://www.barion.com  
**Privacy Policy**: https://www.barion.com/en/privacy-notice/  
**Terms of Service**: https://www.barion.com/en/general-terms/  

By using this plugin, you agree to Barionâ€™s privacy policy and terms of service. The Barion Pixel script (`bp.js`) is loaded remotely from the following URL:  
https://pixel.barion.com/bp.js.

== External Libraries ==

This plugin includes the **Barion PHP SDK (https://github.com/barion/barion-web-php)**, which is located in the `/lib/Barion/` directory. The SDK uses external dependencies such as **CURL** for making API requests. While the plugin itself uses the WordPress HTTP API for compatibility and performance, the Barion SDK may internally rely on **CURL**.
